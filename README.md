# Lightweight Calculator
## Introduction
Lightweight Calculator is a console-based app which allows you to perform calculations such as basic arithmetic, and conversion.
## Details
Lightweight Calculator is made in C++ and is supported on Windows.
## Technical Requirements
You need to use a Windows OS, I am confident that as long as you have enough storage space (don't worry it's not even 1 megabyte) you could get by running this on Windows 3.1 or XP.
After all, it is a lightweight calculator.
## The other yap
Pull requests are welcomed, please make an issue if you have a suggestion for the calculator or have any problems while using the application.
This is a project to help me expand my knowledge of C++.
## Open Source is cool
Feel free to fork this if you want, spy on all the source-code. This is open-source and will remain under the MIT Licence for everyone to use.
## Installation Instructions
